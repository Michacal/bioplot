.SH INTRODUCTION TO BIOPLOT
.sp
You will not be able to use this program or any of its parts to slay a dragon, that I\(aqm sure of, and I do not guarantee
that it is fit for any other purpose at all, but I would appreciate if you would include a reference to this code and my name
in any publications you may write using its features or add a source reference to your code if you include some part(s)
of this code in yours. Especially if you plan to use part of the code please respect the rst_license\&.
.sp
bioplot.py is a program which can draw several plots that can be used
when evaluating the performance of a biometric system. It reads settings from the file \(aqbioplot.cfg\(aq.
But using the \-c option you can specify your own settings file (see rst_settings).
These settings may be used to determine the way information is shown in a plot, what directory plot files
are written to etc.
.sp
The plot types currently supported are: rst_accuracy, rst_detplot, rst_eerplot, rst_histogram,
rst_matrixplot, rst_rankingplot, rst_rocplot, rst_tippetplot and rst_zooplot\&.
.sp
Please read INSTALL.txt, this html documentation (note that the file \(aqmanual.txt\(aq is obsolete) and bioplot.cfg before you try to use
bioplot.py. You\(aqll learn more of the program\(aqs potential than from its command line help message.
.sp
@Windows dudes and dudettes: I\(aqm afraid you have to run the program by hand from a command line or build shortcuts
which not only start the program but also provide the command line options and parameters needed. You\(aqre on your
own here. I\(aqm a linux/OSX command line junky anyway so I did not spend any time building a (windows) gui. But don\(aqt fret. All plots
are shown in an interactive window, you can click on that as much as you like. The interface allows you to zoom in,
click on a point to see the associated label, save the plot in a file etc. etc.
.SS Usage
.sp
What bioplot.py basically does is: read a data file and plot one or more interactive graphs.
You can run bioplot.py from the command line. The follow command will show help info for bioplot:
On OSX and linux run:

that you can use several options at the same time. The sequence is of no importance.
.IP \(bu 2
each time in this documentation you read \(aqpython\(aq as part of a command then on a windows platform use \(aqpython.exe\(aq (without the quotes).

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As you can tell from the list of options you need to choose what type of graph you want.
Bioplot can produce several plots in a row with just one invocation of the program. E.g. if you run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
python bioplot.py \-Z \-A \-E \-i some_input_data_file.txt yet_another_input_file.txt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
the program will produce a zoo plot, an accuracy plot and an EER plot one after the other.
.sp
The input data has to be in a specific format. Actually there are 2 types of format allowed. See \fI\%Data files\fP below.
All plots can be saved. This happens automagically as well, as soon as you click on a plot and press a key, but depending
on the screen size you get more useful results if this happens under your control.
.sp
If you do not provide an input file, the program uses input/testdata_A.txt.
This makes it is easy to try the program. You can try the multi experiment capabilities
of the program by choosing input/testdata_AB.txt or input/testdata_ABC.txt.
.sp
Bioplot when run reads its config file (by default called \(aqbioplot.cfg\(aq) and uses the settings it finds in there.
If no config file exists it uses a set of default values. Have a look at the config file. The program has quite a lot
of settings you may want set to your own liking.
.SS Auto store
.sp
The program does a bit more than its command line arguments suggest.
You will notice this when you run it. It will for instance store all the
target and non target scores it distills from the data file you pass
to it and write them in text files (unless you set saveScores to False in bioplot.cfg).
For this to be usefull always add a name for the experiment you were running to the command line,
otherwise the prefix \(aqtest\(aq is used.
.sp
The experiment name is used in the titles of the plots and in the filenames bioplot produces.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
python bioplot.py \-Z \-e myFirstExperiment
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can use these file for further processing. The experiment name you specify is used as part
of the filename: <exp_name>_<meta_value>_non_target.txt, <exp_name>_<meta_value>_target.txt.
The <meta_value> is taken from the last column of data in the data files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
myFirstExperiment_conditionA_target.txt
myFirstExperiment_conditionA_non_target.txt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The files are stored in the directory specified by \(aqoutputPath\(aq in
bioplot.cfg in it\(aqs [cfg] section. The default path will be \(aqoutput\(aq in
the current directory. You can change this behaviour in bioplot.cfg via the following settings:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[cfg]
outputPath = output
saveScores = True
alwasySave = False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the output path does not exist, bioplot will try to create it. Note: this may require privileges to be set propperly.
If you run the program repeatedly using the same experiment name, the scores are not saved again, saving some processing
time, unless you add the following setting to the config file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[cfg]
alwaysSave = True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default value is False as it is expected that you will run bioplot several times with the same data (hoping this
will speed things up a bit). Note, that if you do not change the experiment name but do change the data, if alwaysSave = False,
the data extracted will not reflect the analysis of the (new) data file used. If you want to have new versions of these files,
you need to delete them before running bioplot.py again (or set alwaysSave to True).
.sp
If you choose to plot a zoo plot, the labels which fall within the doves, chameleons, worms and phantom quartiles
are saved in individual text files: <exp_name>_chameleons.txt, <exp_name>_doves.txt, <exp_name>_phantoms.txt and
<exp_name>_worms.txt. This automatically documents all outliers.

The labels with a normalized standard deviation for their target scores or their non target scores bigger than a maximum standard
deviation are stored in a file <exp name>_limited.txt together with the violating score (have a look at the
rst_zooplot page for a general understanding of how the plot is made).
.sp
Assuming these settings:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

[zoo]
limitStdDevs = True
maxStdDev = 2.0
minStdDev = 0.01

Note that the default setting for maxStdDev = 6.0 * unit std dev.
.SS Save plots
.sp
Any plot you produce will be saved to disk as a png\-file in the output directory as soon as you click on the plot
(to get the window focus) and press a key. The experiment name is used as part of the plot name. Note, it is important to maximise the plot\(aqs window to
get a proper layout of all elements in the plot! If you press \(aqs\(aq, you will be presented with a menu which
will allow you to save the plot anywhere you choose to. If you press a different key, the plot will be saved locally in
the directory specified by outputPath. This happens any time you press a key!
.sp
Note: the keys l, k, g, s and f are predefined keys of the gui. They provide additional functions.
With them you can:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
g: toggle grid on / off
k: toggle between linear horizontal scale and logaritmic horizontal scale
l: toggle between linear vertical scale and logaritmic vertical scale
s: open save menu
f: toggle between standard size and full screen
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any key will make that the file is saved in its window\(aqs dimensions.
To get a nice plot it is wise to maximise the window and then press a key. Then close the window.
.sp
Note that using l and k may lead to warnings if e.g. the scores contain negative values (the log is only defined for numbers >= 0).
.SS Data files
.sp
The command line allows to specify a filename or a list of filenames and a type. The default type is \(aqtype3\(aq which corresponds to a text file
with 7 fields. You need not specify type3 as it is a default. This data type allows you to specify scores of
experiments where multiple files are used to make a model whether this is a training model or a test model.
Note, if you do not provide an input file, the program uses input/testdata_A.txt.
.sp
The data file should contain data in a format like this example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

field 1: string: label identifying a subject (training data).
.sp
field 2: string: name of data file containing biometric features or raw data originating from the subject denoted by field 1 used for making a test/evaluation model. In the example you see a wav\-file, but this can be any string identifying a file or feature set.
.sp
field 3: string: label identifying a subject (test/evaluation data).
.sp
field 4: string: name of data file containing biometric features or raw data originating from the subject denoted by field 3 used for training the reference model. In the example you see a wav\-file, but this can be any string identifying a file or feature set.
.sp
field 5: string: floating point value: score of trial.
.sp
field 6: boolean: ground truth.
.sp
field 7: meta data value for the experiment.
.sp
Field 7 can be used to contrast scores of experiments in most plots.
So if you have 2 experiments where you change one variable, when doing a cross
identification test, the meta value can be used to group the experiment\(aqs scores.
.sp
Let\(aqs have a look at an example data line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
803742 17133729a.wav 803593 16842970b.wav 2.108616847991943 FALSE META_VAL1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This line describes the result of a speaker verification experiment in which was used:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- as training audio samples from the file 17133729a.wav
\- the label 803742 to identify the speaker in the training audio
\- the label 803593 to identify the speaker in the test/evaluation/disputed utterance
\- as evaluation audio samples from the file 16842970b.wav
\- the tag FALSE to denote that the training speaker is not the test/eval speaker
\- META_VAL1 as a label to identify the conditions of the experiment (e.g. this is an experiment
  with training duration X seconds and test duration Y seconds, you may have various
  variables and use other meta labels to identify those).
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The result of the verification experiment was a score of 2.108616847991943.
.sp
If you have done experiments where the training model was made from several audio files, then
in field 4 use some symbolic name.
.sp
Note: bioplot.py uses the filenames in the data file only as symbols, the sample data in
the files is not used in any way.
.sp
E.g. you run an experiment with gender as the main variable and you collect scores of male
to male and female to female comparisons. You need to set the meta value for each score
accordingly. The meta value field allows bioplot to distinguish
between the two conditions and it will in essence plot 2 plots in one overview.
If the same label occurs on more than one occasion in the score list with different meta
values, then the points in a zoo plot with corresponding labels are interconnected
(see interconnectMetaValues setting in bioplot.cfg under [zoo]) . This makes it easy
to see what the effect of an individual label is when changing the experiment\(aqs condition.
.sp
Field 7 must be present. If you don\(aqt want to contrast experiments, then give all lines
the same meta value. Any string of characters (excluding white space) will do except
the special characters mentioned below under \(aqKnown Issues\(aq.
.sp
File type \(aqtype2\(aq is deprecated as of august 2015.
.sp
File \(aqtype1\(aq is a database based data format and meant as an example on how to use bioplot in combination with a
database of scores. Specify \(aqdatabase\(aq as filename on the command line.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
python bioplot.py \-i database \-t type1 \-e \(aqdata taken from db\(aq \-Z
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You will have to adapt the query in the function _readFromDatabase and the function
_decodeType1Results in data.py to your own needs.
.sp
There are several data files (of type3) which are meant as examples to play around
with: input/testdata_A.txt, input/testdata_B.txt, input/testdata_C.txt and input/testdata_ABC.txt
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
python bioplot.py \-e "condition A" \-i input/testdata_A.txt \-Z
python bioplot.py \-e "condition A and B" \-i input/testdata_A.txt input/testdata_B.txt \-Z

.SS All versions
.sp
Keep a copy of bioplot.cfg with your latest settings before updating anything.
.sp
Note: each version you download is self contained. You do not need anything from an existing version to run a new one.
.sp
If you want to only try the new version, download the latest zip file from the github page and unzip it to a new local directory.
If you want to replace the bioplot version with a new one download the latest zip file from the github page, rename the
old bioplot directory to bioplot.org and unzip the new version. Then copy your input and output files from the input and
output dir from the old version into the corresponding directory of the new one.
.sp
Merge your favourite settings in the saved version of bioplot.cfg with the new one. On osx or linux I would use diff or vimdiff for this.
As I\(aqm not a windows user, if you are, you\(aqre on your own.
.sp
From here on, you\(aqre ready to go.
Have a look at the changelog.txt file, the man pages, the html docs and bioplot.cfg to find out about new functions and
settings and read the update section for possible extra update steps.
.sp
When running OSX or Windows do not forget to set either runningOSX or runningWindows in the [cfg] section in bioplot.cfg.

.SH MATRIX PLOT
.sp
A matrix plot can be used to compare scores of different experiments with eachother. It is also usefull to display correlations. If the scores contain labels compared to other labels each comparison resulting in one score, then the plot will show a correlation plot. If labels are compared to multiple instances of other labels, each resulting in groups of scores, then these groups are averages.
To differentiate between experiments the meta value field of the data file is used.
.sp
Matrices can be combined in one plot. Example:
[image]
.sp
This plot shows 6 conditions where the overall score changes from condition to condition. The first 3 labels
correspond to the top row of matrices (from left to right), the next 3 with the bottom row.
If the number of conditions allows it, the plots can be combined into one plot as in the example above.
But it is possible to plot them all next to eachother or above oneanother. If the vertical dimension of each matrix exceeds the horizontal dimension they will be drawn next to each other, otherwise they will be drawn in a vertical bar. To achieve this, set combineMatrices to False in bioplot.cfg:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[matrix]
combineMatrices = False

.UNINDENT

[image]
.sp
The matrices above contain artifical data. In real experiments not all labels may have the same number of scores. This may be due to data shortage, a model not being computed etc. In that case bioplot will accept the scores that exist and plot as many as possible. This is visible in the matrices below. On the right hand side data that is missing is replaced by some average value. The scaling of the grey values is not influenced by these values.

.SH ZOO PLOT
.SS Traditional plot
.sp
A zoo plot shows a scatter type plot where on the vertical axis the mean of the non target
scores and on the horizontal axis the mean target scores are drawn for each label. This leads to
a plot of dots where each dot represents the scores for one subject. The plot below shows an example with one dataset.
The zoo\(aqs special animals (points within quartile ranges) are coloured differently to make them stand out more.
Note: there must be at least one target and one non target score to be able to include a subject\(aqs data in the zoo plot.

.sp
An extention of the zoo plots was shown at the IAFPA 2014 conference in Zurich, Switserland
by Anil Alexander et al. They proposed that adding a measure of the standard deviations of the
scores used to make the plot will add details of the score distributions of the subjects
to the plot. If the option alexanderStyle in [zoo] is set to True, ellipses are drawn
at the positions where the points of a traditional zoo plot would be.
The width and height of the ellipses shown are essentially the standard deviations of the average
target and average non target scores for a given label. Because these may be much bigger or much
smaller than the horizontal and vertical scales of the traditional zoo plot, the mean standard
deviations are scaled by subtracting the overall mean standard deviation and dividing by the
standard deviation of all standard deviations. So they will be centered around zero.
This is in essence a normalization procedure.
The result will be ellipses with a unit width and height and ellipses smaller and bigger than that.
To be able to actually plot the normalised ellipses, the width is multiplied by the range of
scores on the horizontal axis and the height is multiplied by the range of the scores on the vertical axis.
Finally to scale the ellipses their width and height is divided by a scale factor.
This scale factor is related to the number of pixels in the display used to plot the zoo plot.
A value of 150 works nicely for a 1600 ... 1280x1024 display.
To get this type of plot set the following options in your settings file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Note that in the data set there may be subjects with limited scores available. In case there is only one target score,
(or one non target score) one can not plot an ellipse for the corresponding axis.
In this case bioplot provides the option to either set the normalized std dev for this subject to the
minimum value which will result in a flat line for that dimension of the ellipse
or assume this subject is similar to other subjects and set the normalized std dev for this subject to the
unit value derived from the other subject target and non target scores. The default is to use the minimum value allowed.

.SS Helper circles
.sp
Initially in a zoo plot helper ellipses are shown around the unit ellipse. If you resize the plot so that
they become circles, it will be easier to interpret the plotted data points and the shapes of the data points
will become independent of the screen dimensions. If you save a plot when resized in the way suggested you
will be able to compare zoo plots made from different data sets more easily. The helper ellipses will disappear as soon
as you click in the plot. Note, only if the std deviations of the average target scores are similar to standard
deviations of the average non target scores this will help. If this is not the case, then the ranges of the vertical
and horizontal axes differ too much to be able to resize the plot to a square.

.SS Colours
.sp
If you don\(aqt like the colours used, specify your own list in the section [metacolours] of the settings file.
Different colours make it possible to combine multiple data sets in one plot.
Note: don\(aqt use white or some very light colour as the plot\(aqs
canvas is white and you would not see much of a label then.
From a perceptual point you should avoide pure Blue
in combination with other colours as the human eye does not focus
blue light in the same way as the other colours because of chromatic aberation
when viewing multiple colours at the same time.
The meta data values are sorted alphabetically.
The colours are used in the sequence they are listed here.
Note that the labels are of no consequence! They are there for your convenience.
Values should be in R,G,B format specifying integer values
or hexadecimal values (6 digits). Search for colour values on the web using \(aqhtml colours\(aq as the search string
and you will find various lists and examples.

Note that the shape of the ellipses is influenced by the difference in range of the vertical and
horizontal axis. This means that comparing shapes between zoo plots with varying ranges of
mean target and mean non target scores can be very tricky. The lines between the ellipses connect ellipses for the
same label.
.SS Labels
.sp
In some of the plots above you have seen examples of labels shown when you click on the plot. The information shown can
be configured via the config file. You can choose among these:

showNrTargetsAndNonTargets = True
showMeanScores = True

From top to bottom they will show the number of target scores (#T) and number of non target (#nT) scores for the subject;
the average target match score (aTms) and the average non target match score (anTms); and lastly
the average target match score normalized standard deviation (aTmNormStDev) and the average non target match score normalized standard deviation (anTmNormStDev).
.sp
The Labels by default show black text on a yellow background. On OSX (Yosemite) the labels get really big and the text gets the
same colour as the background. Therefore, set runningOSX to True in [cfg], this will
change the yellow background into a grey one.
[image]
.SS Highlighting labels
.sp
If you click on a data point in the plot, a text label will be shown near the point. This makes
it possible to find the name of a data point in e.g. the quartile ranges.
If you are curious where a specific label is in the zoo plot, you need not click on a lot of them to find it.
You can use \-L followed by the labels on the command line. If they are in the plot, they will be highlighted. Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
python ./bioplot.py \-e "condition A and B" \-i input/testdata_AB.txt \-Z \-L 1100 1109 1042

.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will highlight label 1100, 1109 and 1042 in the zoo plot compiled from
the data in \(aqtestdata_AB.txt\(aq and dim the colours of the other points in the plot
making it easy to create a picture for a publication or report. Text labels
will be displayed near the points selected.

.SS Zooplots combined with Histograms
.sp
In the plot shown below the zoo plot is bordered by histograms showing the distributions of the target and non target
scores. To get bioplot to show this, set the following option in bioplot.cfg:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[zoo]
boutenStyle = True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the minimum and maximum values in the histograms are based on raw scores and the axes of the zoo plot
are based on mean scores. This causes the axes to differ and therefore the peak of the histogram is not alligned with the center
of the zoo plot. In this example this is clearly visible for the non target scores. In this zoo plot 2 data sets
are shown combined. Each data set has its own quartile ranges.
[image]
.sp
To get a sort of quantification of the idea of change in position in the plot a circular histogram can be added in the top right corner.
The black ellipses show the mean values of all target and non target mean scores. The circular histogram shows the distribution of angles
of slopes the ellipses for a given subject moved on from one experiment\(aqs results to the other. Bear in mind that due
to the difference in the scale of the horizontal and vertical axes the angles can not be read from the zoo plot easily.
A system\(aqs discrimination appears to be proportional to the distance to the upper right corner of the plot
(where the Doves are) and its calibration appears to be proportional to the distance of a data point to the imaginary
diagonal one can draw from the lower left to the upper right of the plot.
The delta value shown below the circular histogram tries to capture this by averaging all movements towards the upper right of the plot.
The movement is measured by multiplying the absolute movement of an ellipses by the sine of the angle
of movement to the horizontal axis. Note that this measure is computed between conditions sorted in alphabetical order.
E.g. in the conditionA and conditionB data plot, the delta is computed for movement of ellipses from conditionA to conditionB.

Different colors make it possible to combine multiple data sets in one plot.
Note: don\(aqt use white or some very light colour as the plot\(aqs
canvas is white and you would not see much of a label then.
From a perceptual point you should avoide pure Blue
in combination with other colors as the human eye does not focus
blue light in the same way as the other colours because of chromatic aberation
when viewing multiple colours at the same time. Blue will be less visible because
it will not be in focus when other colours are near it.
The meta data values are sorted alphabetically.
The colors are used in the sequence they are listed here.
Note that the labels are of no consequence! They are there for your convenience.
Values should be in R,G,B format specifying integer values
or hexadecimal values (6 digits). Have a look at \fI\%http://colorbrewer2.org\fP\&. I\(aqm certain
you will get inspired to use some nice colours in the plots.
Alternatively you can search for color values on the web using \(aqhtml colors\(aq as the search string
and you will find various lists and examples.

In the data set there may be subjects with limited scores available. In case there is only one target score,
(or one non target score) one can not plot an ellipse for the corresponding axis.
In this case bioplot provides the option to either set the normalized std dev for this subject to the
minimum value which will result in a flat line for that dimension of the ellipse
or assume this subject is similar to other subjects and set the normalized std dev for this subject to the
unit value derived from the other subject target and non target scores. The default is to use the minimum value allowed.

.SS Data separation character
.sp
In data.py the following characters are used to group data: _#_
If they are in your data set, e.g. as part of a label or meta data value, either change your data set or change the
definition of the separation characters in format.py and choose non ambiguous replacements.
.SS Matplotlib on OSX and Ms Windows
.sp
The software works well with matplotlib\-1.5 and up. Some matplotlib versions that are out there will show a plot on the
screen and then exit immediately. If you encounter this, let me know. This can be easily helped. Given that I encountered
this only with older versions of matplotlib I have not implemented any measures for it in the current version of bioplot.

There are some issues with labels in the zoo plots. See rst_zooplot_labels\&.

You may need to set the backend for matplotlib. See rst_install_matplotlib\&.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
.SS Preamble
.sp
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software\-\-to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation\(aqs software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
.sp
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
.sp
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
.sp
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
.sp
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
.sp
Also, for each author\(aqs protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors\(aq reputations.
.sp
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone\(aqs free use or not licensed at all.
.sp
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
.SH GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
.sp
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
.sp
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
.sp
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
.sp
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\(aqs
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
.sp
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
.sp
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
.sp
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.
.sp
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
.sp
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
.sp
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
.sp
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine\-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
.sp
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine\-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
.sp
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
.sp
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
.sp
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
.sp
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
.sp
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients\(aq exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
.sp
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty\-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
.sp
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
.sp
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
.sp
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
.sp
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
.sp
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
.sp
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
.sp
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
.SS NO WARRANTY
.sp
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
.sp
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
.sp
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
.SS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
.sp
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
.sp
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
