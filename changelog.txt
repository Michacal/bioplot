# v0.1, Sept 2013
Created code for ranking and accuracy plot.
Added zoo plot after reading a publication by Yager et al. about their 
variant on Doddington's zoo.

# v0.2, August 2014
Added 'agm and aim std deviations' to zoo plot after reading Anil Alexander's 
abstract for a paper he submitted to IAFPA 2014, Zurich, Switserland.

The width and height of the ellipses shown are essentially the standard deviations of the average
target and average non target scores for a given label. Because these may be much bigger or much
smaller than the horizontal and vertical scales of the traditional zoo plot, the mean standard
deviations are scaled by subtracting the overall mean standard deviation and dividing by the
standard deviation of all standard deviations. this is in essence a normalization procedure.
The result will be ellipses with a unit width and height and ellipses smaller and bigger than that.
To be able to actually plot the normalised ellipses, the width is multiplied by the range of
scores on the horizontal axis and the height is multiplied by the range of the scores on the vertical axis.
Note that the shape of the ellipses is mainly due to the difference in range of the vertical and
horizontal axis. Comparing shapes between zoo plots can be tricky.
Finally to scale the ellipses their width and height is divided by a scale factor.
This scale factor is related to the number of pixels in the display used to plot the zoo plot.
A value of 150 works nicely for a 1600 ... 1280x1024 display.
To be able to draw them they are scaled.

# v0.3, 9 Sept 2014
Added click events. Clicking in zoo plot will show a list of nearest labels including
their average target and non target score. All labels within 1/10 of the minimum of the
height or width of an ellipse are shown. Added histograms to zoo plot.

# v0.4 12 Sept 2014
Added config file 'plot.cfg' containing default settings

# v0.5 21 Sept 2014
Created zoo, format and data object to make things more OO.

# v0.6 29 Sept 2014
Moved a lot of functions common to boutenZoo and alexanderZoo to zoo.py
Added annotations and comments.

# v0.7 Sun Oct  5 18:49:12 CEST 2014
Made preparations for storing at github.

# v0.8 Tue Oct  7 01:10:47 CEST 2014
Added flag for OSX
