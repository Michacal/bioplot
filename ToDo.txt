TODO

sorting of labels in animal text files.
- labels are sorted as strings, this results in odd sequences if labels are numbers

To be implemented:
We do not want a ticker on the radial axis.

Difference in length of labels in legend will influence the layout of the legend
Compute max length first and adapt formatting.
