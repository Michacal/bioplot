Ms Windows
==========
Follow the instructions found here: http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html
I've tried anaconda 2.01 (32 bit version) on W7
This will install python 2.7,7 and a load of python modules amongst which numpy, matplotlib, pyplot
You will be able to run bioplot.py and do much more pythony things ;-)

Copy plot.cf4_4_windows.txt to bioplot.cfg in the working directory (the directory where
bioplot.py is stored) and run the main program ./bioplot.py -h to find out how to use it.
Also look at bioplot.cfg to find out about additional options not available
via the command line interface. There are lots of them. Their values are shown on the
commandline whenever you run the program, unless you choose not to via the appropriate
option in bioplot.cfg

Linux
=====
You need to have python2.7.x installed. On most linux systems
this is the case.

Then install matplotlib and some other modules:

sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-numpy python-scipy

If you get into trouble, talk to your local linux guru. Do not mail me!
Next, copy plot.cf4_4_linux to bioplot.cfg
then run the main program: ./bioplot.py -h to find out how to use it.
Also look at bioplot.cfg to find out about additional options not available
via the command line interface. There are lots of them.

OSX
===
Haven't tried this yet.
So basically you are on your own.
Do mail me a description if you find out how to get things running on
OSX so that I can include it here.
