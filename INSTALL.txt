Ms Windows
==========
Follow the instructions found here: http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html
I've tried anaconda 2.01 (32 bit version) on W7 but I've heard that it works
with the 64 bit version on W8 as well.
This will install python 2.7.7 and a load of python modules amongst which numpy, matplotlib, pyplot and scikit-learn.
You will be able to run bioplot.py and do much more pythony things ;-)
If you get into trouble, talk to your local windows guru before you mail me!

Copy plot.cfg_4_windows.txt to bioplot.cfg in the working directory (the directory where
bioplot.py is stored) and run the main program 

python.exe bioplot.py -h 

to find out how to use it.
Also look at bioplot.cfg to find out about additional options not available
via the command line interface. There are lots of them. Their values are shown on the
commandline whenever you run the program, unless you choose not to via the appropriate
option in bioplot.cfg

Finally take a look at the docs:

Copy and paste this line into internet explorer:

file:///C:\Users\<user name>\bioplot\doc\_build\html\index.html

Make sure you change <user name> into the appropriate name.
You can also navigate to the html directory and double clicking on index.html.
Internet Explorer may indicate that some active X element or script was blocked.
This is caused by the search function in the bioplot docs. This function is perfectly 
harmless (and helpfull), so you can enable it without any risks.

Since there is no way for me to know who downloaded bioplot, other than the downlaoder telling me,
send me an email if you want to be kept in the loop with changes or updates.

Linux
=====
You need to have python2.7.x installed. On most linux systems this is the case.
Then install matplotlib and some other modules using:

sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-numpy python-scipy

I tried it on Ubuntu 14.04 and it worked like a charm.
Next, copy plot.cfg_4_linux to bioplot.cfg
Then run the main program: 

./bioplot.py -h 

to find out how to use it.
Also look at bioplot.cfg to find out about additional options not available
via the command line interface. There are lots of them.  Their values are shown on the
commandline whenever you run the program, unless you choose not to via the appropriate
option in bioplot.cfg
Finally have a look at the docs: copy and paste this line:

file:///home/<user name>/bioplot/doc/_build/html/index.html

into whatever browser you use.

Make sure you change <user name> into the appropriate name.

OSX
===
On OSX 10.9.5 run these commands:

curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

python get-pip.py

pip2 install matplotlib

sudo git clone https://github.com/josbouten/bioplot.git

Then change the owner of the bioplot directory to your user:

sudo chown -R your-user-name:staff bioplot

Next, copy plot.cfg_4_osx to bioplot.cfg

From here on, you're ready to go.
Run the main program from a terminal like so

./bioplot.py -h 

to find out how to use it.
Also look at bioplot.cfg to find out about additional options not available
via the command line interface.  There are lots of them.  Their values are shown on the
commandline whenever you run the program, unless you choose not to via the appropriate
option in bioplot.cfg

Finally have a look at the docs: copy and paste this line into internet explorer:

file:///Volume/Users/<username>/bioplot/doc/_build/html/index.html

into safari.

Note: in contrast to the example plots supplied labels in plots on OSX will appear in
black on a grey background.

Since there is no way for me to know who downloaded bioplot, other than the downlaoder telling me,
send me an email if you want to be kept in the loop with changes or updates.
